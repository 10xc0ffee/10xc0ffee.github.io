Building scalable systems has always intrigued me, especially the challenges and learning opportunities they present. My interest began with competitive programming, where I discovered a natural affinity for problem-solving and continuous learning.

In the past, I worked on core storage infrastructure at a major cloud provider in China, contributing to the development of a distributed system designed to handle massive workloads efficiently. Currently, my focus is on a cloud database system, where I’m working to improve its performance and resilience for mission-critical applications. Over time, I’ve developed a strong instinct for tackling complex challenges, particularly in areas like problem-solving, performance optimization, and system architecture.

I’m passionate about building scalable systems, exploring distributed technologies, and refining system architecture to achieve better reliability and efficiency.

This blog is a small space for me to capture my thoughts, share my work, and document the learning process. I also hope it becomes a platform for exchanging ideas and learning from others’ experiences and insights.
