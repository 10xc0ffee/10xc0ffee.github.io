I’ve always been drawn to the challenges of building scalable systems. My journey began with competitive programming, where I discovered that problem solving and learning new things were a perfect fit for my nature. I used to work on the core storage infrastructure at a major cloud provider in China, where I helped build a distributed system capable of handling massive workloads.

These days, I’m working on a cloud database system, focusing on enhancing its performance and resilience for mission-critical applications. Solving complex problems to make systems more reliable and efficient is something I find incredibly exciting. I’m passionate about building scalable systems, exploring distributed technologies, and continuously learning along the way.

This blog is a simple space for me to jot down thoughts, share what I’m working on, and document the things I’m learning. I also hope it can be a place where I can learn from the experiences and insights of others.
